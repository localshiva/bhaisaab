# Bhaisaab

Bhaisaab is a web application to track family expense and gather information about the amount available each month using a Google Sheet. It is built using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

Google Sheets API is used to fetch data from Google Sheets. This app will not have any backend code.
